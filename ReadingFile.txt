Planet Earth 

The Earth's inner core is almost as hot as the surface of the Sun, with a temperature
 of around 5,500 degrees Celsius (9,932 degrees Fahrenheit).

The Earth's atmosphere extends much farther than most people realize, with the outermost layer,
 called the exosphere, stretching out for thousands of kilometers.

The Earth's rotation is gradually slowing down due to tidal forces caused by the Moon's
 gravitational pull. In fact, the length of a day has increased by about 1.8 milliseconds
  over the past century.

The Earth's magnetic field is constantly shifting and changing, and has even flipped in the past,
 with the north and south magnetic poles switching places.

The Earth is not a perfect sphere, but is actually slightly flattened at the poles and bulging
 at the equator due to its rotation.
